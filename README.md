# .NET MAUI Recipes

.NET MAUI (Multi-Platform App UI) is the latest framework from Microsoft for creating cross-platform Applications targetting Android, iOS, MacOS, Windows. More platform support is coming. As the MAUI ecosystem is evolving, knowledge is scattered in multiple forums such as stackoverflow, github, Youtube, blogs and many other fourms.

This is an attempt to make the programmer's life easier by writing down the key concepts and frequently-used code recipes for .Net MAUI at one place. I am also making this beginner friendly to help new devleopers join the MAUI community.
